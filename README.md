# react-ssr

Basic example of a server side rendered React app based on [Demystifying server-side rendering in React](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/demystifying-reacts-server-side-render-de335d408fe4). 🚀

App HTML will be rendered by the server, before ReactDOM hydrates it (so you are able to see content and navigate with JavaScript disabled). 👌🏻

# Install

`npm install`

# Build

Run `npm run build` to build the front end assets.

# Run

Run `npm start` to to start the server at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
